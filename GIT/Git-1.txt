Version Controlling
=====================
This is the process of preserving older and latest
versions of the code.
All the developers upload their code into the
VCS.The VCS's accept the code uploads coming from
various developers and create one integrated project
out of those uploads.
The next time when developers download the code
from the VCS they will find the code created by the
entire team.Process of uploading into VCS is called 
"cehckin" and downloading from VCS is called "checkout"


VCS's also preserve the different versions of the code
so that the developers can swithc between any version
based on requirement.

VCS's also track who is making what kind of changes

VCS's are of two types
1 Centralised Version Controlling
2 Distributred Version Controlling

Centralised Version Controlling
---------------------------------
	Here we have a remote server where version
controlling happens.All the developers checkin their
code into this central server.
Eg: SVN(SubVersion)

Distributred Version Controlling
-----------------------------------
	Here a local repository is installed on every
developers machine where version controlling happens
at the level of the individual developer.Later from
the LR the code is uploaded to the remote repository
where version controlling happens at the level of the
complete team.
