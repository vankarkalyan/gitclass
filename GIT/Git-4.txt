Downloading from remote git repository
---------------------------------------
This can be done in 3 ways
1 git clone
2 git fetch
3 git pull

git clone: This will download the entire remote repository
from git hub into individual developers machine irresepective of whether that code is already present or not
Syntax
  git clone remote_repo_url

git fetch: This will work only when there are modifications in the code between the local repository and remote repository
git fetch will download the modified files and place them on a remote branch.We can go to that remote branch check if those changes are accptable or not and if they are acceptable we can merge them with master

1 Create some modifications to any file on github
  Open github.com
  Click on our remote repository
  click on any file that we want to modify
  Click on Edit icon
  Make some changes--->click on commit changes

2 In git bash
  git fetch

3 Check the modified file on master branch
  We will not see any modifications

4 The modifications will be on the remote branch
  Move to the remote branch
  git branch -a
  git checkout -b remotes/origin/master

5 View the modified file
  If the changes are accpetable merge with master
  git checkout master
  git merge remotes/origin/master


git pull:This will also work only when there are modifications
between the local repository and the remote repository.But it will directly merge the modified files with master branch

1 Open github.com
2 Make some changes to a file--->commit changes
3 In git bash
  git pull
The modified files can be directly seen on the master
