Git when working on the local machine uses three
sections.
1 Working directory(workspace)
2 Stagging Area
3 Local Repository

Working directory
--------------------
	Initially all the files created by the 
developers are stroed in a folder called working
directory and these files are initially called
untracked files.

Stagging Area
---------------
	Files from working directory are moved to
an intermediate memory area called stagging area.
The files present here are called stagged files.

Local Repository
------------------
	All files from stagging area will be moved
into the local repository and this is where version
controlling happens.These files are called commited
 files

1 To initilise the working dir to accept git commands
  Open git bash
  cd path_of_working_dir
  git init
  The above command will create a hidden folder called
  .git where it stores some configuration files for 
  maintianing the local repository

2 To send file from working dir to stagging area
  git add filename
  To send multiple files into stagging area
  git add file1 file2 file3
  To send all files and fodlers into the stagging area
  git add .
  Note  . represents present working directory

3 To unstage files ie bring files back from stagging
  to untracked section
  git rm --cached filename
  (or)
  git reset filename

4 To send files from stagging to local repository
  git commit -m "Some commit message"

5 To see the status of the untracked and stagging section
  git status

6 To see the total commits that are done in LR
  git log
  To see the commit history in a simplified format
  git log --oneline


.gitignore
-------------
This is a special file where we can store the
private filenames.Any filename that is mentioned 
in .gitignore will not longer be accessed by git

1 Create few files
  touch file1 file2 file3 file4

2 Check the status of git
  git status
  It will show all the above 4 files as untracked file

3 Create a hidden file .gitignore and enter the above filenames
  cat > .gitignore
  file1
  file2
  file3
  file4
  To come out of cat command press ctrl+d (EOF)

4 Check the status of git
  git status
  It will not longer show the above created four files
  as untracked
