Git Branching
====================
	This is a feature of git using which the developers
can create seperate functionalities of code on different branches and later merge them with the master branch.This will help in creating the code in an unclutterred way

1 To see the list of all branches
  git branch
  To see all branches(local and remote)
  git branch -a

2 To create a branch
  git branch branchname

3 To move into a branch
  git checkout branchname

4 To create a branch and also move into it
  git checkout -b branchname

5 To merge a brnach with master
  First move to master
  git checkout master
  git merge branchname

6 To delete a branch that is merged
  git branch -d branchname
  This is also called soft delete

7 To delete a branch that is not merged
  git branch -D branchname
  This is also called hard delete


note: whenever a branch is created whatever is the commit history of the parent branch will be copied to the newly created branch

note: Irrespective of where a file is created or modified that file belongs to that branch form where it is commited
